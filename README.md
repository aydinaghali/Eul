# Welcome to Eul
Eul is an esoteric programming language. It has been desinged to be short and precise. It is a stack-based language.

# Naming
Eul's name comes from words "eu", meaning "good" in latin, and "l", contraction of word "language". It means "good language".

# Memory
The only data structure in Eul is its single stack. This stack supports basic operations, such as push and pop, as well as other operations, including arithmetic operations, number to string conversion and others. Every item of stack is 32 bit integer.
# Computational class
Eul has stack roll operations, which put the first item on stack to the back of stack or the last item on stack to the front. These operations make the language Brainfuck equvalent, thus Turing complete.

# Example programs
- Hello World
  `Hello, World!`
- Cat
  ` ` (empty program)
- Quine
   * `this is quine`
   * `it is also quine`
   * `a`
- Print all ASCII characters
  `0.0$~:1+:126<0?~`
